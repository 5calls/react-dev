As if that’s not enough: more than a thousand businesses and a majority of American voters support the agreement.\n\nAlthough Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement, individual states maintain their control over their own carbon emission standards and clean energy priorities. If enough states commit to maintaining the standards of the Paris Climate Agreement, the collective achievement can offset the adverse effects of the Trump-led national withdrawal. Governors Jerry Brown of California, Andrew Cuomo of New York and Jay Inslee of Washington formed a \"United States Climate Alliance\" immediately after the announcement of Trump's Paris Accord decision.

Despite these promises, his 2018 budget proposal recommends cutting Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments to disabled workers by $72 billion over the next 10 years.\n\nTrump's administration argues that SSDI budget cuts will address wasteful and fraudulent access to these benefits. However, SSDI applicants must meet a host of eligibilty criteria to qualify for benefits. They must have worked a set number of years, have accumulated Social Security credits, and be under the age of 65. SSDI benefits are not overly generous (the US places 30th out of 34 peer countries for this type of benefit), nor are they easy to access - 60% of applications are denied. Despite these hurdles, there are nearly 9 million disabled workers currently receiving benefits; for 80% of beneficiaries, SSDI is their sole source of income.\n\nThese proposed SSDI cuts, particularly if combined with a repeal of the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare and budget cuts to Medicaid, would devastate millions of Americans who are already struggling to stay afloat in the face of health issues and economic insecurity.\n\nThe House and Senate Budget Committees will use Trump's budget proposal as guidance when finalizing their own budget recommendations. Constituents must make it clear to our members of Congress that SSDI and other social safety net programs represent our core values of supporting those most in need, and must not be eliminated in order to provide tax breaks to corporations and the most wealthy Americans.",

It includes a set of regulations intended to prevent “too-big-to-fail” banks from causing another economic crisis. One critical piece of legislation under Dodd-Frank is the Volcker rule, which prohibits banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments, such as those that led to the housing market crash in 2008. The Volcker rule also limits banks in their relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds. Dodd-Frank also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which ensures that banks, lenders, credit card corporations, and other financial companies treat their customers fairly and protect consumers from practices like predatory payday lending. \n\nHouse Republicans have introduced legislation known as the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 (H.R. 10) that would repeal the Volcker rule and strip the CFPB of key enforcement powers, including the ability to fine institutions for unfair lending practices (which the CFPB recently used to fine Wells Fargo $100 million for opening 2 million accounts that their customers didn't know about). The repeal of the Volcker rule alone would increase big banks' profits by hundreds of millions of dollars a year while putting the American public at risk for another recession driven by irresponsible banking practices.

Reduction of this critical service is a cruel and unnecessary tactic designed to pad a budget that favors corporations and the rich over the general population.\n\nSNAP is an effective program with proven results.

By providing a safety net to families during economic hard times, SNAP is also an important way to lift them out of poverty. Furthermore, SNAP is highly efficient, with 95% of dollars spent on the program going directly to benefits.

The bipartisan bill, sponsored by Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), would establish an independent commission of 12 non-governmental appointees to fully investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election and any potential ties to the Trump campaign. \n\nSince Speaker Ryan has failed to bring this bill to the floor, on May 17th Rep. Pelosi filed a discharge petition on HR 356: a parliamentarian procedure that allows a bill to be brought to the floor without passing through committee. If a simple majority of House members sign the discharge petition, Pelosi can force a floor vote on the measure. Currently, every Democrat has agreed to sign the petition.\n\nWhile a special prosecutor has been appointed after the abrupt firing of FBI Director Comey, an independent commission is still needed to ensure a fair and thorough investigation. A special prosecutor will be able to press criminal charges if necessary, but he/she could still be controlled or even fired. An independent commission, however, would have more autonomy and will produce an extensive, conclusive report of its findings, including information of wrongdoings that may not warrant criminal charges but is still vital for the American public to know.",

This will be the Senate's first recess since the House passage of the American Health Care Act and is thus constituents' first opportunity to discuss healthcare with their Senators while the Senate is actively drafting healthcare legislation. According to some insiders, if there is enough \"blowback\" back home regarding healthcare, the Senate may drop their attempt to repeal Obamacare.\n\nBut in addition to healthcare, members of Congress must address a myriad of other issues during this recess, including the continuously escalating reports of the Trump campaign's connections to Russian election interference, Trump's own efforts to obstruct investigations of his administration, and the 2018 Budget. While Budget Director Mick Mulvaney has released the Trump administration's full budget proposal, the House and Senate will ultimately decide what programs remain safe and fully funded and which will be gutted.\n\nHold your representatives accountable for their actions and demand they face their constituents while they're home and available to do so.

In fact, the AHCA would leave more Americans uninsured by 2026 than were uninsured prior to the ACA's passage in 2010. \n\nThe AHCA's rollback of Medicaid expansion alone would immediately deprive 11 million low-income people of insurance access. The AHCA's changes to the individual insurance market, where roughly 19 million Americans buy insurance (via federal and state marketplace plans and other nongroup plans), would also reduce insurance coverage. By replacing income-based tax credits with age-based credits, the bill would drive up nongroup premiums dramatically for low-income, older enrollees. For some older adults, their premiums could go up by as much as 800%. However, wealthy Americans would receive tax breaks totaling roughly $900 billion thanks to the new tax credit structure.\n\nAn estimated 1 in 6 people live in states that would request AHCA regulatory waivers, which would allow insurers to reinstate price discrimination based on health status and end coverage of essential health benefits. The CBO estimates that many sicker people would be priced out of the insurance market altogether. For many more consumers, out-of-pocket spending on maternity care, mental health and substance abuse services could increase by thousands of dollars in a given year. \n\nThe CBO estimated the AHCA could reduce premiums overall, but it would achieve this by making insurance unattainable for older and sicker Americans and by allowing insurers to offer much skimpier plans.

More troubling still is that even after convicts have served their time, many cannot vote, obtain employment, get loans, or even rent apartments. The downstream effects of mass incarceration on poor urban families and communities are nearly insurmountable.  \n\nThe response from legislators on both sides of the aisle has been a swift and clear \"no.\" Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Representatives Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Bobby Scott (D-VA3) have reintroduced the Justice Safety Valve Act, which allows prosecutors and judges to use their discretion to consider each case separately.

      "reason": "The Trump administration, along with Secretary Betsy DeVos, laid out their proposal for the 2018 Department of Education budget - a long list of program cuts and funding shifts that would leave public schools underfunded and vulnerable students unprotected. The $11 billion worth of budget cuts would completely dismantle teacher training programs, after school programs (that mostly serve poor children), class-size reduction efforts, the Special Olympics, and 20 other programs designed to address bullying prevention, mental health, gifted students, as well as arts, foreign language, history and STEM education. \n\nNot only does the budget proposal defund a multitude of vital programs, it also devastates the entirety of the public school system. $400 million would be spent on expanding charter and religious schools, and $1 billion dollars spent a new grant to promote voucher or 'school choice' programs in public schools, effectively diverting funds away from already struggling public schools and into private schools. Trump and DeVos also have their eyes on overhauling federal financial aid with a proposal to kill the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (which allows student borrowers to have their debt erased if they work for the government or a nonprofit for at least 10 years), and replace all student loan repayment plans with a single plan, a move that could give one contractor too much power and ability to abuse student borrowers.\n\nAs if this large number of troubling changes aren't enough and DeVos's priorities aren't already clear, DeVos has also proposed cutting the Dept. of Education's Office of Civil Rights staff by 10% (complaints are on a significant rise) and increasing the budget for her own security by millions of taxpayer dollars.",

In addition to drastic funding cuts to the EPA, Planned Parenthood, and the Education Department (effectively diverting funds from public schools to voucher programs), the latest proposal also slashes safety net and anti-poverty programs, a historically severe move that would devastate the lives of millions of low-income families.\n\nThe proposed budget includes an $800 billion cut to Medicaid from the AHCA plus an additional $610 billion totally a 47% budget decrease; a $191 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) or food stamps; as well as cuts to school lunch programs, disability benefits, and domestic abuse assistance programs. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) responded to the proposal, \"This would pull the rug out from so many Americans who need help.\" Alongside these harmful and draconian spending cuts, the budget also makes room for major tax cuts to the wealthy.\n\nThe administration's budget proposal will now be taken into consideration by Congress, with the House and Senate Budget Committee holding hearings with agency and department heads and engaging in debate over their own version of a 2018 Budget. Constituents must make it clear to Congress that Trump's budget strays far from true American values, and that crucial government programs that aid individuals in need of protection and assistance should not be cut just to give tax breaks to millionaires and corporations.",
